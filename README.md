## Who am I ?
Hey there I'm Gianni, a 1st year Epitech student in Lille. I am looking forward to learn `Javascript` by myself and I'm currently learning `C` and `Bash` at Epitech.  
I'm currently working on multiple projects related to Epitech but I aim to participate in the creation and the development of a Discord bot in the future.  
You can contact me on Discord (Gianni æ„›#0280), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CapucheGianni) and also by [Mail](mailto:gianni.henriques@gmail.com)
